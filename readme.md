1. What is the difference between **getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll**?
   Ans:
   getElementById: By using getElementById() we can access any element by its Id in JavaScript file.

getElementsByClassName: By using getElementsByClassName() we can access elements by their Class in JavaScript file.

querySelector: By using querySelector() we can access elements by their Id, Class or tagName in JavaScript file.
When we need first value of the element(Class/tagName), we can get it by using querySelector().

querySelectorAll: By using querySelectorAll() we can access elements by their Id, Class or tagName in JavaScript file.
When we need all values of the element(Class/tagName), we can get it by using querySelectorAll().

2. How do you **create and insert a new element into the DOM**?
Ans:
<body>
  <div id="container"></div>
  <script>
    let para = document.createElement("p");  
    para.textContent = "This is a new paragraph.";  
    document.getElementById("container").appendChild(para);  
  </script>
</body>
[This will create a <p> element inside the container div]

3. What is **Event Bubbling** and how does it work?
   Ans:
   Event bubbling means an event moves from the innermost element externaly through its ancestors.

4. What is **Event Delegation** in JavaScript? Why is it useful?
   Ans:
   Instead of attaching event listeners to many child elements, just attach a single event listener to a parent element, and let event bubbling handle the rest. This is called event delegation.
   Usefulness:
   (a)Saves memory and improve performance
   (b)if new child elements are added later (via JavaScript), the parentâ€™s listener will still catch their events.
   (c)Easier to manage one listener instead of many.

5. What is the difference between **preventDefault() and stopPropagation()** methods?
   Ans:
   preventDefault():
   (a)Prevents reload(default browser behavior) of an element.
   (b)Does not stop the event from bubbling.
   stopPropagation():
   (a)Stops the event from bubbling up.
   (b)Does not affect default browser behavior.
